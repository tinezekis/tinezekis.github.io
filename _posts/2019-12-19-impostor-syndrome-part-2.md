<h3>Impostor Syndrome: Warning Signs</h3>

<p>
  So let's get into something practical. How can we recognize Impostor Syndrome when it starts to sneak up on us? Here are some warning signs that you might be experiencing Impostor Syndrome:

  <li><strong>You have difficulty accepting praise.</strong> Lots of people feel weird getting compliments, but "impostors" have trouble even recognizing praise as valid.</li>
  <li><strong>You're an over-worker.</strong> Perhaps you keep working on a project until it is well beyond the level that the average person would deem acceptable.</li>
  <li><strong>You feel the need to be the best.</strong> Many "impostors" were high achieving as children, and feel compelled to compete when they get into new situations and surround themselves with other smart and talented people.</li>
  <li><strong>You're described as a perfectionist.</strong> We "impostors" often hold ourselves to impossible standards of perfection. Anything short of this is considered a failure.</li>
  <li><strong>The fear of failure can paralyze you.</strong> Have you ever opted not to try something, in order to avoid the possibility of failing?</li>
  <li><strong>You avoid showing confidence.</strong> This one is more common among people from marginalized genders. This avoidance can come from a fear of appearing to overcompensate, or from a fear of not being able to measure up to expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>You actually dread success.</strong> Not feeling worthy of success can lead us to feelings of guilt when we are acknowledged or rewarded for it.</li>
  <li><strong>You compare your struggles and obstacles to those of others.</strong> Everyone compares themselves to others, but "impostors" constantly tell themselves that everyone else is getting by with fewer struggles in life than they are.</li>
  <li><strong>You associate praise with charm over actual talent.</strong> Because people with Impostor Syndrome are typically highly intelligent and good at interacting with others, people often find them charming. It is then easy to associate any praise from supervisors or other authority figures as a result of that charm, rather than of our intellect, talent, or hard work.</li>
  <li><strong>You focus more on what you <em>haven't</em> done.</strong> Going back to that impossible standard of perfection, it's often difficult for us to meet our goals or milestones according to our own expectations. So instead of focusing on our many accomplishments, we tend to dwell on what we haven't done, or what we haven't done "well enough".</li>
  <li><strong>You're convinced you aren't enough.</strong> This last one tends to cut pretty deep. This is about that overwhelming feeling of being a fraud - the fear that one day, everyone will realize you're not everything they thought you were. It's the feeling that you are less qualified than your peers, or that you lucked into where you are today.</li>
</ol>
