  In this post, we will explore a concept in CSS design. CSS stands for <b><u>C</u></b>ascading <b><u>S</u></b>tyle <b><u>S</u></b>heets. This is a tool used by many web designers to turn a single column of plain text into the beautiful websites that you see all over the internet. There are many aspects of CSS one would have to understand in order to stylize a website, but I think it will be best if we take this one step at a time. For now, we will focus on one issue: spacing.
</p>
<p>
  Margins, borders, and paddings can all serve as spacers between objects on a website. Let's back up for a moment and talk about what constitutes an object. An object is really anything on the site: an image, a text box, a heading, a button, a table, a data cell within a table, a section of color, etc. A web designer arranges the objects to create the site you see online. But how do can we determine how much space each object takes up? Obviously, each object has a size, but that's not where the story ends. We can also determine how much space the object needs around it, creating space <i>between</i> objects. This is where our margins, borders, and padding come in.
</p>
<p>
  From the inside out, we go from the object itself out to the padding, then the border, and finally the margin. As state previously, an <b>object</b> has its own dimensions (width x height). The <b>padding</b> is the space between the object and its border. The <b>border</b>, which may be made visible by the web designer, surrounds the object. The <b>margin</b> is the space between the border and other objects on the site. Please see the diagram below for further clarification.

<h3>More on Margins</h3>
<p>
  As discussed above, a margin is the space between an object's border and other objects on the site. We define the length of this space using CSS by typing: <pre><code>margin: [length];</code></pre> Here, we can type our length using several units of measurements. For now, let's stick with pixels (px). One pixel is a dot on your screen. This is what it would look like if we set objects to have 40-pixel margins (<code>margin: 40px</code>):
</p>
<div class="margin-example-1">
  Big
</div>
<div class="margin-example-1">
  Margins
</div>
<div class="margin-example-1">
  =
</div>
<div class="margin-example-1">
  Far
</div>
<div class="margin-example-1">
  Apart
</div>
<p>
  Or we could use <code>margin: 1px;</code> and get something like this:
</p>
<div class="margin-example-2">
  Small
</div>
<div class="margin-example-2">
  Margins
</div>
<div class="margin-example-2">
  =
</div>
<div class="margin-example-2">
  Close
</div>
<div class="margin-example-2">
  Together
</div>

<h4>Unequal Margins</h4>
<p>
  We can also choose different margins for the different sides of an object. Each side can be set using the commands <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, or <code>margin-left</code>, respectively. Or, we can indicate all four at once by typing <code>margin</code> and listing each margin length in the order listed above (starting with the top and moving clockwise around the object). For example, the code <code>margin: 4px 3px 2px 1px;</code> would produce a top margin of 4 pixels, a right margin of 3 pixels, a bottom margin of 2 pixels, and a left margin of 1 pixel. Below is an example of an object with unequal values for its margins on various sides:
</p>
<div id="margin-example-3">
  My top and left margins<br>
  are much larger than my<br>
  bottom or right ones.
</div>
<h3>Borders for Beginners</h3>
<p>
  A border is exactly what it sounds like: it borders the object. We can define several attributes of a border such as its weight, style, and color. We can also determine whether or not it will be visible (the style "none" would render the border invisible). Our code for creating a border around an object looks like this: <pre><code>border: [weight] [style] [color];</code></pre>For example, here is what you would get if you entered <code>border: 15px solid black;</code> and <code>border: 2px dashed red;</code> for two objects, respectively:
</p>
<div id="border-example-1">
  I have a thick, solid, black border.
</div>
<div id="border-example-2">
  My border is thin, dashed, and red.
</div>
<h3>Prepping Your Padding</h3>
<p>
  Padding, like the margin, represents empty space. However, this space is between the object and its border. We set the padding using: <pre><code>padding: [length];</code></pre> Here are some examples of the effect padding can have on an object such as a text box:
</p>
<div id="padding-example-1">
  There is little<br>
  space between my<br>
  border and me.<br>
  <b>I feel cramped!</b>
</div>
<div id="padding-example-2">
  My border is<br>
  too far away.<br>
  <i>I feel lonely!</i>
</div>
<div id="padding-example-3">
  My padding is<br>
  just right. <i><b>I feel<br>
  like Goldilocks!</b></i>
</div>
<h4>Unequal Borders and Padding</h4>
<p>
  Just as with margins, we can apply our borders and padding unequally on different sides:
</p>
<div id="unequal-border-padding-example-1">
  My border is ridiculous! Some sides<br>
  thick, some sides thin; some solid,<br>
  one dotted, one dashed...
</div>
<div id="unequal-border-padding-example-2">
  How do you think I feel?<br>
  Look at my uneven padding!
</div>
<p>
  In case you're curious, here is the CSS code from our mismatched border example:
  <pre><code>border-top: 7px dotted blue;</code></pre>
  <pre><code>border-right: 12px solid green;</code></pre>
  <pre><code>border-bottom: 10px dashed red;</code></pre>
  <pre><code>border-left: 3px solid yellow;</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  And here is the CSS code from our unequal padding example:
  <pre><code>padding: 50px 10px 0px 150px;</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Well, I hope this has given you some insight into the wonderful world of CSS design. I'm excited to be learning all of this, and I hope you are, too. Please check in on my blog as I continue my journey toward becoming a web developer. In the meantime, happy coding!
