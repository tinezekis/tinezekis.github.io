<p>
  One of the most powerful weapons I use to fight off Imposter Syndrome is my <em><strong>Hype Squad:</strong></em>
  those people who are in my corner, cheering me on, and reminding me that I deserve my success.
</p>

<p>
  When I <a href="{% link talks.html %}">speak about Imposter Syndrome</a>, I always encourage my
  audience to assemble their Hype Squads, to develop that support system for themselves. Beyond that,
  I'm here now to tell you that you need to make sure your Hype Squad is <em>diverse</em>. You need
  different types of people, and different types of relationships, in order to experience the full
  benefits of having a Hype Squad.
</p>

<p>
  Here's an example: my mom is my biggest fan, bar none. She is always the first to let me know how
  talented she thinks I am, and how wonderful a job I did on a presentation (or a blog post...hi, Mom!).
  It's very sweet. But when I'm trying to fight off Imposter Syndrome, encouragement from my mom doesn't
  usually do the trick. She's completely biased, and wired to think I'm great even if my output is objectively mediocre.
</p>

<p>
  So, perhaps I'll turn to some old friends, and they'll tell me that they think I'm amazing at my
  job. And then I remember that none of them have worked in my industry, or know what kinds of
  lifelong hackers I'm comparing myself to.
</p>

<p><em>Now, what?!</em></p>

<h2>Let's talk about the 3 kinds of people you need on your Hype Squad</h2>

<br>

<h3>1. The Collaborator</h3>

</div>

<p>
  The Collaborator is a peer - a friend, teammate, or colleague - who is always ready to remind you
  that you're capable and qualified. Ideally, this person works within your field, and knows what it
  looks like - or <em>can</em> look like - to be successful. You have similar or comparable goals,
  and are able to compare notes when either of you overcomes a challenge. When you struggle, this
  person "gets it" with little to no explanation needed. You support each other through difficulties
  and celebrate one another's accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
  As a member of your Hype Squad, having seen you conquer countless obstacles, this person helps you
  overcome Imposter Syndrome by reminding you of <strong>your resiliency and multitude of talents.</strong>
</p>

<h3>2. The Coach</h3>

<p>
  The Coach is a mentor who excels in an area in which you aspire. This person can guide you, offer
  advice, and help you to explore possible paths forward. They recognize your potential, and affirm
  that you have the tools you need to be successful. And in the case where you might be lacking,
  they can help you hone the skills you need in order to close the gaps.
</p>

<p>
  As a member of your Hype Squad, having succeeded in areas that interest you, this person helps you
  overcome Imposter Syndrome by letting you know what's possible, and by reassuring you that
  <strong>you have what it takes</strong> to get to where they are.
</p>

<h3>3. The Novice</h3>

<p>
  Conversely, The Novice is someone who seeks mentorship from you. This person is walking a path on
  their journey that you have already traversed. Even if you don't think you have much experience
  yet, always remember: <em><strong>no matter where you are in your journey, there is always someone
    behind you, wanting to get where you're going.</strong></em> The Novice looks to you for advice,
    giving you opportunities to reflect on your accomplishments, missteps, and learnings. Do not
    underestimate the extent to which helping others can also help you. According to
    <a target="blank" href="https://effectiviology.com/protege-effect-learn-by-teaching/">the Protégé Effect</a>,
    an excellent way to solidify your own learning is to teach.
</p>

<p>
  As a member of your Hype Squad, having inquired about your story and asked for your advice, this
  person helps you overcome Imposter Syndrome by providing you with opportunities to reflect on
  <strong>your accomplishments and the pieces you put into place to achieve them.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Bonus: The BFF</h3>

  </caption>
</div>

<p>
  The BFF is, as you may have guessed, your Best Friend Forever. This person is a lifelong friend,
  who is always on your team. Or maybe this person is your mom. The point is that they think the
  world of you and they are happy to celebrate every victory, big or small. While this person may
  not know all of the ins and outs of your field, they do know <em><strong>you.</strong></em> They
  know the wonderful and unique qualities you bring to your relationships, and to all other aspects
  of your life.
</p>

<p>
  As a member of your Hype Squad, this person helps you overcome Imposter Syndrome by
  <strong>cheering you on, no matter what!</strong>
</p>

<br>

<p>
  As you build up your Hype Squad, make sure you're including The Collaborator, The Coach, and The
  Novice. Try to connect with someone at work who may be working on similar goals to your own. Seek
  out a mentor to guide you along your journey. And offer to mentor others…share your story with
  those who are trying to follow in your footsteps. But, perhaps most importantly, remember that
  all of these are two-way relationships.
</p>

<h2>Ideally, every member of your Hype Squad has you as a member of theirs.</h2>

<p>
  Choose these relationships wisely, because you will be called upon to hype these people up as well!
