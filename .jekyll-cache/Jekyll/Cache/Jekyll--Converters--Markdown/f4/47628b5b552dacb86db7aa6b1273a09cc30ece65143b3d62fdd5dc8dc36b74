I"ğ<p>I remember I was in middle school when my father explained to me that, â€œSome stereotypes are just true.â€ The example he gave was that Nigerians are loud. When I consider my Nigerian relatives, this generally holds true. â€œWe are a lout people,â€ he said. And my goodness, we get even louder when weâ€™re together! Obviously, I have met some very quiet Nigerians in my life. But this stereotype, this understanding, that Nigerians are loud has stuck with me my whole life. To this day, I often attempt to censor myself by stifling my laughter; I feel self-conscious laughing aloud in public. I know that the typical American is not thinking about loud Nigerians on a day-to-day basis (nor do people usually know that I am Nigerian without some instruction from me on the matter). But I know that African Americans are also considered to be â€œa loud peopleâ€. And I feel weird confirming this stereotype when I throw my head back and cackle loudly in public, though it is in my nature to do so.</p>
