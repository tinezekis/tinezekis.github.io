<h5>A Note from 'Tine on "Imposter" Syndrome vs. "Impostor" Syndrome</h5>

<p>
  Both spellings, "imposter" and "impostor", are correct. The "-er" spelling tends to be more
  popular than the "-or" spelling, but both are completely acceptable. Unfortunately, when I began
  speaking on the topic and creating accompanying materials, I did not realize that I had chosen the
  less common spelling. In order to make my content on the subject easier to find, I have decided to
  migrate from the "-or" spelling to the more commonly used "-er" spelling. In the meantime, please
  forgive any spelling inconsistencies in the materials below.

<h2>Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<h4>Slaying the Beast</h4>

<p>
  Imposter Syndrome is a nasty beast that preys on us at all levels of our careers. But there are
  times when we are particularly vulnerable to its lures. Learn how to recognize the beast when it
  starts to sneak up on you, and more importantly, what to do about it! You will leave this talk
  armed with tools for fighting off Imposter Syndrome, and the confidence to strut into your next
  meeting, standup, or job interview. Once you’ve learned to slay the beast, you’ll be ready to just
  slay, in general.

<h2>Gender Inclusion as a Verb</h2>
<h4>Walking the Walk of Inclusion for All Genders</h4>

<p>
  It’s easy to say, “Yes, transgender and nonbinary folks can come to this Women in Tech event” or
  “All genders welcome!” And we might really mean it in our hearts. But have we done the work to
  make it true? From the language we use, to the speakers we invite, to the facilities we rent, we
  can be intentional about creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. Whether you’re an
  individual contributor or the CEO, learn the specific actions you can take to make your company,
  events, and daily interactions truly inclusive for all genders.

<h2>Curriculum to Command Line</h2>
<h4>Why Teachers Make Great Coders, and What Your Team Can Learn from Them</h4>

<p>
  Perhaps you’ve heard the oft-quoted statistic that teachers make 1500 decisions per day in their
  classrooms. How do they <em>do</em> that?! Don’t you think a mind with that kind of training would
  be great at writing algorithms and defining edge cases? Well, it turns out that they are! Find out
  why former educators make awesome coders, communicators, teammates, and leaders. And, perhaps more
  importantly, learn what your teams can do to hone those same skills.

<h2>Career Changers & Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<h4>Leveraging Your Unique Strengths</h4>

  role. Instead of going into the job with a deficit mindset, let’s talk about the unique skills you
  bring to the table that you’ve honed throughout your previous experiences.
