<h2>Gender Inclusion as a Verb</h2>
<h4>Walking the Walk of Inclusion for All Genders</h4>

<p>It’s easy to say, “Yes, transgender and nonbinary folks can come to this Women in Tech event” or “All genders welcome!” And we might really mean it in our hearts. But have we done the work to make it true? From the language we use, to the speakers we invite, to the facilities we rent, we can be intentional about creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. Whether you’re an individual contributor or the CEO, learn the specific actions you can take to make your company, events, and daily interactions truly inclusive for all genders.</p>

<h2>Curriculum to Command Line</h2>
<h4>Why Teachers Make Great Coders, and What Your Team Can Learn from Them</h4>

<p>Perhaps you’ve heard the oft-quoted statistic that teachers make 1500 decisions per day in their classrooms. How do they <em>do</em> that?! Don’t you think a mind with that kind of training would be great at writing algorithms and defining edge cases? Well, it turns out that they are! Find out why former educators make awesome coders, communicators, teammates, and leaders. And, perhaps more importantly, learn what your teams can do to hone those same skills.</p>

<h2>Career Changers & Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<h4>Leveraging Your Unique Strengths</h4>

<p>It's very common for Impostor Syndrome to impact career changers, especially in their first dev role. Instead of going into the job with a deficit mindset, let’s talk about the unique skills you bring to the table that you’ve honed throughout your previous experiences.</p>
